      <p>
        Presence, in the context of coaching or therapy, is not simply being physically together...
      </p>

      <p>
        A coach or therapist may hold space beautifully during a session...
      </p>

      <p>
        FountainAI was built not to replace presence, but to extend it...
      </p>

      <p>
        When someone speaks a metaphor in session...
      </p>

      <p>
        Most digital tools fragment this process...
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s missing isn’t information, but presence...
      </p>

      <p>
        FountainAI offers this continuity by listening differently...
      </p>

      <p>
        When a coach re-enters the next session, they’re not starting over...
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        This is especially valuable in therapeutic work with existential themes...
      </p>

      <p>
        To be clear, FountainAI is not an agent...
      </p>

      <p>
        The value of FountainAI, then, is not in automating coaching...
      </p>

      <p>
        And in a time when presence is increasingly scarce...
      </p>

      <p class="signature">
        FountainAI was built for that.
