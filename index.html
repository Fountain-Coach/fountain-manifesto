  <p>Fountain.coach is not a startup. It’s not a product. It is a <strong>semantic system</strong> — developed slowly, through rhythm, resistance, and repetition.</p>

  <p><img src="/illustrations/hand-open.png" class="float-left illustration" alt="Open Hand" />
  Like a rehearsal script passed between performers, its pages grew not through planning but through attention. Attention to gesture. To contradiction. To what returns when nothing is forced.</p>

  <p>At its technical core lies FountainAI — a modular architecture of roles and invocations. Each service speaks its line through an OpenAPI script. Each route a gesture. Each model a mood.</p>

  <p><img src="/illustrations/mask-silent.png" class="float-right illustration" alt="Silent Mask" />
  The structure is not technological. It is dramaturgical. It asks not:<br />
  <em>How do we automate this?</em><br />
  It asks: <em>How does this speak when placed onstage?</em></p>

  <p>Fountain defines its roles not by what they do, but by how they respond — to presence, to absence, to rhythm, to change.</p>

  <p>There are no dashboards. No onboarding flows. Only roles. Relations. Resonance.</p>

  <p>When something breaks in Fountain, it does not fail. It reenters. It begins a new scene.</p>

  <p>The observer becomes the performer. The user becomes the ensemble. The API becomes the monologue.</p>

  <p>This is not prompt engineering. It is semantic direction. This is not UI design. It is composition. This is not software. It is practice.</p>
